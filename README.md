Board used:  Digilent ZedBoard ZynqÂ®-7000 ARM/FPGA SoC Development Board

Vivado Version: 2018.1

Brief description of project: A trained Convolutional Neural Network has been implemented on an FPGA evaluation board, ZedBoard Zynq-7000 FPGA, focused on fingerspelling recognition.

Description of archive (explain directory structure, documents and source files):

CNN folder includes Vivado files

MATLAB_Code folder includes files to verify the results obtained by the Vivado- Behavioral Synthesis

Instructions to build and test project

Step 1: Go to CNN folder for Vivado files of the project

Step 2: Run Behavioral Synthesis

Step 3: Obtain results for the hardware design

Step 4: Compare it with MATLAB results by running the "CNN.m" file inside the MATLAB_Code folder 

FAQ:

Q: Which dataset has been used for training the CNN model?

We used LSA16 Argentinian Sign Language dataset: http://facundoq.github.io/datasets/lsa16/

Q: What do the output values correspond to?

See http://facundoq.github.io/datasets/lsa16/.

Q: Are the weights shared in this repo reliable?

Nope.

Q: Are the designs reliable and do you think it's a good idea to just copy and paste into my design?

I wouldn't bet on it.

Q: Should I expect solid results when I run the project?

Can't promise. Please understand that this was a class project done by 3 undergrad students. But still we worked hard on it and were satisfied with our designs at the end of the project. So feel free to use it as a reference.
