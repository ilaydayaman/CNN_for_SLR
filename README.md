Board used:  Digilent ZedBoard Zynq®-7000 ARM/FPGA SoC Development Board

Vivado Version: 2018.1

Brief description of project: A trained Convolutional Neural Network has been implemented on an FPGA evaluation board, ZedBoard Zynq-7000 FPGA, focused on fingerspelling recognition.

Description of archive (explain directory structure, documents and source files):

CNN folder includes Vivado files

MATLAB_Code folder includes files to verify the results obtained by the Vivado- Behavioral Synthesis

Instructions to build and test project

Step 1: Go to CNN folder for Vivado files of the project

Step 2: Run Behavioral Synthesis

Step 3: Obtain results for the hardware design

Step 4: Compare it with MATLAB results by running the "CNN.m" file inside the MATLAB_Code folder
